Email spam detection with machine learning
Context:

Classifying emails into distinct labels can have a great impact on customer support. By using machine learning to label emails the system can set up queues containing emails of a specific category. This enables support personnel to handle request quicker and more easily by selecting a queue that match their expertise.

Objectives:

This study aims to improve the manually defined rule based algorithm, currently implemented at a large telecom company, by using machine learning. The proposed model should have higher F1-score and classification rate. Integrating or migrating from a manually defined rule based model to a machine learning model should also reduce the administrative and maintenance work. It should also make the model more flexible

v1 --------> spam/ham object, v2 --------> massage object, Unnamed: 2 -----> NAN object, Unnamed: 3 -----> NAN object, Unnamed: 4 ------> NAN object

As we saw, we used previously collected data in order to train the model and predicted the category for new incoming emails. This indicate the importance of tagging the data in right way. One mistake can make your machine dumb, e.g In your gmail or any other email account when you get the emails and you think it is a spam but you choose to ignore, may be next time when you see that email, you should report that as a spam. This process can help a lot of other people who are receiving the same kind of email but not aware of what spam is. Sometimes wrong spam tag can move a genuine email to spam folder too. So, you have to be careful before you tag an email as a spam or not spam.
